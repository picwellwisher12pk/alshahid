### Database (User Action Required)
- [ ] Ensure PostgreSQL is running on localhost:5432
- [ ] Create database: `alshahid_db`
- [ ] Run `npx prisma db push` to apply schema
- [ ] Run `npx prisma generate` to generate Prisma client
- [ ] Run `npm run db:seed` to populate with test data

## üìã Quick Start Guide

### 1. Setup Database
```bash
# Ensure PostgreSQL is running on localhost:5432
# Create database: alshahid_db

# Apply schema
npx prisma db push

# Generate Prisma client
npx prisma generate

# Seed with test data (includes admin, teachers, students)
npm run db:seed
```

### 2. Test Credentials
After running the seed script, you can login with:

**Admin Account:**
- Email: `admin@alshahid.com`
- Password: `Admin123!`

**Teacher Accounts:**
- Email: `ustadh.ahmed@alshahid.com` / Password: `Teacher123!`
- Email: `ustadh.ibrahim@alshahid.com` / Password: `Teacher123!`

**Student Accounts (with login):**
- Email: `zainab.parent@example.com` / Password: `Student123!`
- Email: `omar.parent@example.com` / Password: `Student123!`

### 3. Test API Routes
```bash
# Start development server
npm run dev

# Test teacher creation
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/teachers \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer {admin_token}" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "email": "teacher@example.com",
    "fullName": "Teacher Name",
    "password": "SecurePass123!",
    "bio": "Experienced Quran teacher"
  }'

# Test student creation
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/students \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer {admin_token}" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "fullName": "Student Name",
    "age": 12,
    "contactEmail": "parent@example.com",
    "teacherId": "{teacher_id}",
    "createLoginAccount": true,
    "email": "student@example.com",
    "password": "StudentPass123!"
  }'
```

## üéØ Priority Implementation Order

2. Implement student-teacher assignment API
3. Test full student lifecycle

### Phase 2: Trial Conversion Workflow (HIGH PRIORITY)
1. Update trial request API for conversion
2. Create conversion endpoint
3. Build admin interface for approval

### Phase 3: Class Scheduling (MEDIUM PRIORITY)
1. Implement class CRUD APIs
2. Add calendar view component
3. Build scheduling interface

### Phase 4: Progress Tracking (MEDIUM PRIORITY)
1. Implement progress log APIs
2. Build teacher progress entry form
3. Create student progress view

### Phase 5: Invoice & Payment (MEDIUM PRIORITY)
1. Implement invoice management APIs
2. Setup Supabase for file storage
3. Build payment receipt upload
4. Create admin verification interface

### Phase 6: Dashboards (AFTER APIs)
1. Admin dashboard with stats
2. Teacher dashboard with scoped data
3. Student portal

## üìù Notes

### Data Scoping
All API routes use role-based data scoping:
- **Admin**: Sees everything
- **Teacher**: Sees only their assigned students
- **Student**: Sees only their own data

### Security
- All routes require authentication
- Role checking on every request
- Teacher ownership validation
- SQL injection prevented by Prisma

### File Uploads
Payment receipts will be stored in Supabase Storage:
- Bucket: `payment-receipts`
- Public read for admin/teacher
- Authenticated upload for students
