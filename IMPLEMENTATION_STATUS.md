### Infrastructure
- [ ] Supabase setup for file storage

### Database
- [ ] Run `npx prisma db push` (requires PostgreSQL running)
- [ ] Create seed script for initial admin user
- [ ] Generate Prisma client

## üìã Quick Start Guide

### 1. Setup Database
```bash
# Ensure PostgreSQL is running on localhost:5432
# Create database: alshahid_db

# Apply schema
npx prisma db push

# Generate Prisma client
npx prisma generate
```

### 2. Create Initial Admin
Create a seed script or use Prisma Studio to create first admin user:
```typescript
// User with role='ADMIN'
email: "admin@alshahid.com"
password: (hashed) "Admin123!"
role: "ADMIN"
```

### 3. Test API Routes
```bash
# Start development server
npm run dev

# Test teacher creation
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/teachers \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer {admin_token}" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "email": "teacher@example.com",
    "fullName": "Teacher Name",
    "password": "SecurePass123!",
    "bio": "Experienced Quran teacher"
  }'

# Test student creation
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/students \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer {admin_token}" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "fullName": "Student Name",
    "age": 12,
    "contactEmail": "parent@example.com",
    "teacherId": "{teacher_id}",
    "createLoginAccount": true,
    "email": "student@example.com",
    "password": "StudentPass123!"
  }'
```

## üéØ Priority Implementation Order

### Phase 1: Core Student Management (HIGH PRIORITY)
1. Complete student CRUD APIs
2. Implement student-teacher assignment API
3. Test full student lifecycle

### Phase 2: Trial Conversion Workflow (HIGH PRIORITY)
1. Update trial request API for conversion
2. Create conversion endpoint
3. Build admin interface for approval

### Phase 3: Class Scheduling (MEDIUM PRIORITY)
1. Implement class CRUD APIs
2. Add calendar view component
3. Build scheduling interface

### Phase 4: Progress Tracking (MEDIUM PRIORITY)
1. Implement progress log APIs
2. Build teacher progress entry form
3. Create student progress view

### Phase 5: Invoice & Payment (MEDIUM PRIORITY)
1. Implement invoice management APIs
2. Setup Supabase for file storage
3. Build payment receipt upload
4. Create admin verification interface

### Phase 6: Dashboards (AFTER APIs)
1. Admin dashboard with stats
2. Teacher dashboard with scoped data
3. Student portal

## üìù Notes

### Data Scoping
All API routes use role-based data scoping:
- **Admin**: Sees everything
- **Teacher**: Sees only their assigned students
- **Student**: Sees only their own data

### Security
- All routes require authentication
- Role checking on every request
- Teacher ownership validation
- SQL injection prevented by Prisma

### File Uploads
Payment receipts will be stored in Supabase Storage:
- Bucket: `payment-receipts`
- Public read for admin/teacher
- Authenticated upload for students

## üìû Next Steps

To continue implementation:
1. Ensure PostgreSQL is running
2. Run `npx prisma db push`
3. Create seed script for first admin
4. Complete remaining API routes following patterns in existing files
5. Build frontend dashboard components
6. Setup Supabase for file storage

The foundation is solid - the remaining implementation follows the same patterns!
